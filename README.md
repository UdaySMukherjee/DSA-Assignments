# DSA Codes

This repository contains my collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) codes.

## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find various DSA implementations and solutions to popular algorithmic problems. The goal is to provide a resource for learning and reference purposes. Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own projects or learning.

## Data Structures

This section contains implementations of various data structures such as:

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree
- Heap
- Hash Table
- Graph
- ...

Each data structure has its own directory within the repository, containing the implementation code and any associated tests or examples.

## Algorithms

This section contains implementations of important algorithms such as:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., Binary Search)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)
- Dynamic Programming algorithms
- ...

Each algorithm has its own directory within the repository, containing the implementation code and any associated tests or examples.
